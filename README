Math program for kids

Written by Richard Arends for his 6 year old son

The program knows 10 levels  A level stands for the highest number we calculate with. So within level 1
the highest number will be 5 and within level 7 the highest number will be 100

It works with the operands + and - but is easily extended with more.

Exit with 'q' to get statistics
